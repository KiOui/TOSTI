## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+ (recommended to use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv))
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependency management
- Git

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KiOui/TOSTI.git
   cd TOSTI
   ```

2. **Install Poetry**
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

3. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   poetry env use python3.13
   poetry install
   ```

4. **Activate virtual environment**
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

5. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   cd website
   ./manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create a superuser**
   ```bash
   ./manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Load initial data (optional)**
   ```bash
   ./manage.py loaddata tosti/fixtures/default.json
   ```

8. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   ./manage.py runserver
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Development Notes
- SAML authentication is disabled in development mode
- Use `/admin-login` in production for local authentication
- API documentation is available at `/api/docs`

## 🐳 Production Deployment

TOSTI is deployed using Docker and Docker Compose in the [PGO environment](https://github.com/miekg/pgo) at CNCZ (Radboud University IT department).

### Docker Deployment

1. **Build and run with Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
   ```env
   YIVI_SERVER_TOKEN=your-yivi-token
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secure-password
   DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn
   # ... other variables
   ```

### PGO Deployment

For deployment on the CNCZ infrastructure:

```bash
# Deploy the application
pgoctl -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -- dockervm02.science.ru.nl:tosti//up

# View logs
pgoctl -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -- dockervm02.science.ru.nl:tosti//logs

# Stop the application
pgoctl -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -- dockervm02.science.ru.nl:tosti//down
```

**Note**: You must be connected to the CNCZ VPN and have your SSH key in the `ssh` directory.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Key Settings

Configuration is managed through Django Constance for runtime settings:

- **General**: Footer text, cleaning scheme URL
