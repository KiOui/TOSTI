<h3><i class="fa-solid fa-sign-in-alt"></i><br>1. Log in</h3>
<p>
    Before you can start ordering, first <a href="{% url "login" %}?next={{request.path}}">login using your
    RU account</a>.
</p>
<hr>
<h3><i class="fa-solid fa-map-marker-alt"></i><br>2. Choose your venue</h3>
<p>
    On the <a href="{% url "index" %}">home page</a>, there is an overview of all venues where you can place
    orders. Is your favourite venue not available to order? Too bad, you can only wait...
</p>
<hr>
<h3><i class="fa-solid fa-cart-plus"></i><br>3. Place your order</h3>
<p>
    Check out the queue of orders and decide whether you want to place an order. Hit the 'place your order'
    button and pick the products you want to order. After placing your order, you will be added to the queue
    and your orders will be prepared with love.
</p>
<p>
    Note that you can not order an unlimited amount of products, there are restrictions on how many items you
    can order in total and of a specific kind of product.
</p>
<hr>
<h3><i class="fa-solid fa-clock"></i><br>4. Wait...</h3>
<p>
    After placing your order, all you can do is wait. In the queue of the venue, you can see how things are
    going. Orders with a <i class="fa-solid fa-user"></i>-icon are your own orders. You can see the status of your order by looking at the label behind it.
    This will initially be <i class="status-button bg-warning text-white" style="font-style: normal; font-size: 1rem;">Processing</i>.
</p>
<p>You may notice that your orders are displaying a
    <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-danger" style="max-height: fit-content;">Not paid</span>
    label. If you pay for your order, this label will dissappear.
    It is not required to pay upfront, you can also pay when your order is ready.
</p>
<hr>
<h3><i class="fa-solid fa-check-circle"></i><br>5. Ready!</h3>
<p>
    When your order is finally ready, the label will turn into
    <i class="status-button bg-success text-white" style="font-style: normal; font-size: 1rem;">Done</i>.
    Make sure to be present in the venue, because this is the time your name will be called and you can pick up
    your order! If you do not pay or pick up your order, you will be blacklisted and will not be able to order anymore.
</p>
<p>
    Bon appetit!
