        <h3>Who are we</h3>
        <p>
            This website is being maintained by <a href="https://tartarus.science.ru.nl" target="_blank">Tartarus</a>,
            the foundation managing the student canteens of the <a href="https://science.ru.nl" target="_blank">Faculty of Science</a>
            of the <a href="https://ru.nl" target="_blank">Radboud University Nijmegen</a>.
            We can be reached via <a href="mailto:tartarus@science.ru.nl">tartarus@science.ru.nl</a>, or for technical matters,
            via <a href="mailto:www-tartarus@science.ru.nl">www-tartarus@science.ru.nl</a>

        <h3>Your account</h3>
        <p>
            To use most features of this site, you need a user account. The accounts are provided via the
            <a href="https://openid.science.ru.nl" target="_blank">Faculty of Science's OpenID service</a>.
            When you log in for the first time, your username, full name and email address are requested via this OpenID
            server and stored.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you use your account for services, such as ordering products or requesting songs, we naturally store
            this data too.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data is stored on the grounds of legitimate interest (when you use the music-control feature) and
            contractual necessity (for ordering products). Your name will be visible to other users when you order a product
            or when you request a song. Your email address will never be shown to other users.
        </p>

    <div class="container">
        <h3>How long we keep your data</h3>
        <p>
            Your account will be kept for a period of a year after your last login and will, without notification, be removed
            after you haven't used it for more than a year. However, whenever your credentials for the Faculty of Science OpenID
            service expire, you won't be able to access your account anymore either.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your song requests and orders will be stored for a year and will be anonymized afterwards.
        </p>

        <h3>If you want to access your data</h3>
        <p>
            If you want to access your the data we have of you, you can contact us via email and we will provide you with
            the records we keep. This holds as well for if you want your data to be deleted or rectified.

        <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to the data above, this website also uses <a href="https://analytics.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>
            for generating visitor statistics. However, this data is collected anonymously and will also not be linked to the account of
            logged in users.

        <h3>Data Protection Authority</h3>
        <p>
            In case you think we have processed your data unlawfully and wish to file a complaint, you always have the right to do so at
            the Dutch Data Protection Authority, the <a href="https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl" target="_blank">Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens</a>.
            But of course, we would prefer it if you would first just notify us about the issue, so we can solve it together ðŸ˜….
